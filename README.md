# Visual-Basic
## Strategic Highlights
This project allows user to send email with an attached report to multiple recipients from the
data sheet. We want to update this template using VBA code to create a static version and
email it to a list of people. We will define the recipient list in a separate sheet.
## Operating Highlights
1. This code will automatically create necessary folders to save the output excel sheet.
2. We have an Email data sheet to contain the list of people who are going to receive the report
and the email.
3. Sending mail using Microsoft Outlook, primary target is corporate people who are using
Outlook as their default email program.
## ABOUT PROJECT
This project has assumed a situation where the user has to send an email to a
large amount of people along with a report from the company itself.
In order to achieve the required automation, I have used the following libraries:
  • Microsoft Outlook Object Library
  • Microsoft Scripting Runtime Library
You can find these libraries under the References section of your Microsoft Excel VBA
